# exercism-rust

Here are all of my [Exercism Rust track](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust) exercises.

I'm new to Rust, and haven't done much programming in a very long time, so my solutions might be a bit... bad. If anybody runs across this and would like to provide feedback, feel free to!

Some of the exercise folders have the original `readme.md` file included with them that I found on their [Github Repository](https://github.com/exercism/rust/tree/master/exercises). It is MIT licensed, so I have the same license on this repository. All code in the `src/` folders is mine (sometimes with the help of others' solutions), but tests, readmes, etc. are all from Exercism.
