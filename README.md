# exercism-rust

Here are all of my [Exercism Rust track](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust) exercises.

I'm new to Rust, and haven't done much programming in a very long time, so my solutions might be a bit... bad. If anybody runs across this and would like to provide feedback, feel free to!

Exercise folder names with an underscore before them aren't supposed to be more special than others. They're just the ones I've worked on most recently.
